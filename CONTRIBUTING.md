Contributing to JSONCDC
-----------------------

Please use `cargo fmt` as part of the commit process. (CI and `make test` do a
style check so non-conformance will break the build.)

Please ensure that contributed Bash, SQL, Python and other files all:

1. resemble the surrounding code, and

2. contain lines no longer than 79 columns.
